Hello,

I just canceled my support of the Cable Regime and I would like to at
least pick up the 3 networks and NBC.  :)   I do not have tons of
money nor even a few pounds so what I am looking for is the best solution
for reception for under 100 dollars.  I have seen modules that you plug
into your wall outlet that ""supposedly"" make your entire house an
antenna.  I have to admit, even with my limited knowledge of wavelength
and aerial reception, this seems dubious in its claims for ""excellent
reception"" at best.  I'll try anything, though, if it WORKS.  I am in
a non-mountainous area, approximately 50 miles from the transmitting stations
which are pretty large (Montgomery Alabama pop. 200,000) and Colombus Goergia,
pop. 100,000+.  Any recommendations of products, brand-names, prices and 
company info (catalog ordering numbers, addresses etc.)?  Thank you in
advance.

Could someone please tell me if a 1/4 decoder is the same as a 1 to 4
demultiplexer. I know how to link 2 of these to get an 8 output circuit,
but how do I link 5 of these to make a 1/16 multiplexer. Sorry if this
seems like a lame question, but I'm only a newbie to electronics, and I
have to do this circuit. Please make any mail as droolproof as possible.

What you have is one of the LD players from a video game (Dragon's Lair,
Space Ace, etc). Call Pioneer Technicial Support 213-498-0300 (at least
that's the number I called them at) and ask for the LD-V1000 Interface
Guide. It shows how the parallel interface should be wired and the codes
for the commands (play, pause, reject, etc). The guide is mainly for hooking
the player to a computer, but with a little work, you could build a wired
controller.

How do you spell ""tuna helper"" ? 

I gather by off-shore assembly you mean that adcoms are built by 
blue-fin tuna's who are into that squid-fi sound?  (I agree on that one). 
My Adcom 555 preamp did sound better after installing the famous  
""running the chips class ""A"" resistor mod"", and replacing the metal 
bottom cover with plexiglass,, too bad the factory could not make em sound 
better,, but better sound, unfortunately, does not appear to be a priority 
with Adcom, else the mods would neither have been necessary, nor would they 
have improved what was already touted as superlative state-o-d-art le'sound. 
I really want to hear from all those people out there who have traded up  
from an sp9II (even an sp3a!) to a GFP-555/etc., or maybe from those that 
have dumped their forte' amps for a GFA-555/etc....

These circuits abound in most electronic project books.  If you're more
inclined to buy something, try Radio Shack.  I think they still have a
device that is designed to disconnect an answering machine when an
extension line is lifted.  It has LED indicators also.

The following is based on copies I was given of some articles published in
Hearing Instruments. I would appreciate any comments about this and other
'new' technology for hearing aids.

The ReSound system was developed on the basis of some research at AT&T and
appears to take a different approach from other aids. It appears to me that
a new 'programmable' aid like the Widex just uses a more flexible (and
programmable) version of the classical approach of amplifying some parts of
the spectrum more than others and adding some compression to try and help
out in 'noisy' situations.

The major difference in the ReSound approach is that it divides the
spectrum into low and high frequencies (splitting point is programmable),
apparently based on the fact that lots of vowel information can be found in
the low frequencies, while the important consonant information
(unfortunately for me) is in the high frequencies. The two bands then are
treated with different compression schemes which are programable. They have
also developed a new fitting algorythm that builds on what they call
'abnormal growth of loudness'.

This latter is interesting and fits my own personal experience, though I
think the phrase is missleading. What appears to be the case is that as you
exceed the minimum threshold for a person with hearing loss, the deficit
becomes progresslively less compared to normals and by the time you reach
the 'too loud' point the sensitivity curves appear to converge.  This means
that if you just boost all sound levels, you are overloading at the high
end for people with hearing losses. Hence what you want is progressively
less amplification as the signal get closer to the maximum tolerable point.
You want to boost low volume sounds more than high and do so potentially
differently for the low and high frequency parts of the spectrum (specially
for someone like me who is relatively normal up to 1000 cps and then falls
off a cliff).

Aids with simple compressors don't descriminate between energy in the low
and high frequencies and can therefor 'compress' useful high frequency
information because of high volume of low frequency components.
Particularly impressive was the ReSound performance with whispered speech
and in simulated restaurant noise situations.

We used to buy Beckman 110 and HD110 (""ruggedized"") versions for use
by electricians in the steel mill where I work.   After a while we
got round to filling all the current-input jacks with silicone -
electricians have a regrettable habit of not checking where the last
guy left the leads before using a 3 1/2 digit 0.5 % autoranging $400
meter to check if a fuse is good or not. Its very hard on meters
(and electricians) when you put the milliamp shunt across a 600 volt
bus. 
  But that's not why we stopped buying Beckmans - after a while a 
lot of them got ""funny"" in the LCD display.  A black stain would
spread from one edge, or else they'd come adrift from those
Zebra connectors and fail to operate.    Now we buy Flukes, the
low-end 20 series mostly ( and we still fill the amp jack with 
silicone). 
  What the world needs is a meter that won't let you change ranges or
turn it on/off with a lead stuck in the amps jack - a little bit of
clever plastic detailing would take care of this and make the world
safer for electricans, anyway.
   Not that I've ever put a meter on the wrong range into a live 
circuit, no, not me...not more than a dozen times, anyway....

>Thanks.

You've asked a toughie of a question.  There are many different drugs which
are used for chemotherapy.

The overall purpose of chemotherapy (don't worry about the spelling.  Some of
these crazy medical words are impossible to spell! :-) is to either destroy
cancer cells or to keep them from growing.  Different drugs have different
effects on cancer cells, and therefore, it is not uncommon to use more than
one drug at a time.

Some chemotherapeutic drugs are effective anytime during the growth cycle
of a cell.  Others work only at specific times during the cell cycle.

The first phase of the cell cycle is G1; it is when the protein synthesis
and RNA systhesis occurs.  In the second phase, S, synthesis of DNA occurs.
The third phase is G2; The DNA splits and RNA and protein are synthesized 
aagain.  In the fourth phase, M (or Mitosis), the cell may divide.

There are drugs which are effective in each phase.  Some stop DNA synthesis.
Others stop the cell from dividing. Others wreck protein synthesis.
At any rate, the end result that is being sought is for the cancer cells
to stop growing.

If what you are seeking is ""practical"" advice, I apologize for rambling
on the techno stuff.  Some side effects are pretty common.  Chemo. drugs
are rather nasty.  It can cause a person to lose their appetite and to 
experience nausea and vomiting.  Things to help this include eating small
frequent meals.  It is also suggested that if nausea/vomiting (hereafter
known as n/v) occurs that the person notify the doctor; there are medicines
tthat help nausea.  Diarrhea can be an effect.  Antidiarrheal medications 
can be given, and good skincare and fluid intake are important.

Probably the one of biggest concsern is hair loss.  This does not always
happen.  It depends on what drugs are being given, and on the person 
themself.  Different people taking the same drug can and do have different
side effects.  I have seen some literature which states that wearing a snug
headband and/or wearing an ice cap can help reduce hair loss, presumably
by reducing blood flow to the scalp.  If anyone has seen research on this
too, I would love to see it, and possibly some bib data.

I highly recommend making contact with the American Cancer Society.
They have a vast selection of literature and information.  In addition,
if your friend has had a mastectomy, I highly recommend ""Reach for Recovery"".
It is a support group comprised entirely of women who have lost a breast 
because of cancer.  They can offer some excellent support and suggestions.

If you have further questions, please send me E-mail.  I hav some good
access to information, and I enjoy trying to help other people.

I wish the best to you and your friend.

I am trying to build a circuit that detects the presence of video (Vs.
a blank screen) by monitoring the R,G, and B outputs of a graphics
card.  It should be able to detect the presence of a single pixel at
65 MHz, which would mean detecting a 15 NS pulse.  It should also be
able to tell the difference between a blank screen (about 300 mv)
and a dim screen (say, around 310 mv).  Oh yes, it also needs to be
cheap.  

My first circuit was a dismal failure.  I used 3 compariators; each
compariator had the + input going to one of the guns, the - input
went to a reference created by a voltage divider(a potentiometer).

The first problem was that the compariator was way too slow.. I
needed to get several pixels in a row before it would fire the
compariators, so I could have a whole screen full of text, but my
circuit would not detect it.   

The second problem is that there was more noise on the reference then
the smallest difference between a blank screen and a dim screen.  In
fact the difference between completely black and completely white is
only 650 mv.  I am wondering if I am going to have to amplify the
video signals to make this work.  

There are faster compariators, but they are expensive, and require 
split supplies.   I would need to replace my .49 quad compariator
with three 1.89 compariators, and create a whole new power supply
circuit.  

At this point, I think what I need is some sort of transistor
circuit.  Transistors are fast and cheap and should do the trick...

Unfortunately, I am way out of my league when It comes to designing
transistor circuits, so I am appealing to the net for help.  Any
ideas, tips, circuits, pointers, references, etc. would be greatly
appreciated.  

Oh yes, I only sample the output of this thing every second or so, so
I don't need a fast response time at all, however, I haven't found a
way to take advantage of that fact.

Thanks a lot for any help anybody might be able to give. Of course,
you will have my undying gratitude.

Thanks for the resposes as they were all good ideas and I am looking at using a
couple of the ideas. I recieved in the mail today the spec sheets on the mil.
spec version of Exar's XR-2240 timer/counter chip. It is stable down to -50 C
and sucks very little power. They show an application for a ultra-long time
delay (up to several years depending on the RC time constant). In this
application, they have two of them cascaded together. The reset and trigger
pins of both chips are tied together and the timebase of the second chip is
disabled. In this configuration, the output is high when the system is reset.
When triggered, the output goes low and stays that way for a total of 65,536 x
the timing cycle of the first chip. The total timing cycle of the two chips can
be programmed from To = 256 x R x C to 65,536 x R x C in 256 steps by selecting
any combination of the counter outputs to the timer output. The beauty of it
is, the timebase chip would only have to have a 100uF timing cap and a 391K
resistor for 39.1 seconds per timing cycle. So I can get a maximum of
2,562,457.6 seconds between timing cycles (39.1 x 65,536 or about 29 days !)
Of course, that's much more than I need (14 days). But the counter allows for
256 binary steps that can be selected for the output for the 'pellet puker'.
After the first 14 days and it trips, it would reset its self for the next 14
day timing cycle and so forth.

Power is still a problem though. A few ideas that you suggested was to bury the
electronics in a hole dug in the snow (as an insulator) and put the pellet
puker up on a tower above the estimated snow fall with a solar panel on it to
keep a charge on a lithium battery pack. I like that idea ;-) This thing has to
work for at least six weeks for three samples and the gas valves are 12 volts
to spit the pellets out onto the snow. Anyway, I ordered the XR-2240's to see
what I can do with them. Should be interesting (as long as I'm not the one that
has to go digging up the pellets in the middle of Antartica freezing my buns
off ;-)

Thanks again everyone...

The areas that are least likely to hurt are where you have a little 
fat.  I inject on my legs and gut, and prefer the gut.  I can stick
it in at a 90 degree angle, and barely feel it.  I'm not fat, just
have a little gut.  My legs however, are muscular, and I have to pinch
to get anything, and then I inject at about a 45 degree angle,and it
still hurts.  The rate of absorbtion differs for subcutaneous and  
muscular injections however--so if it's a daily thing it would be
best not to switch places every day to keep consistencey.  Although
some suggest switch legs or sides of the stomach for each shot, to prevent 
irritation.  When you clean the spot off with an alcohol prep, 
wait for it to dry somewhat, or you may get the alcohol in the
puncture, and of course, that doesn't feel good.  A way to prevent
irratation is to mark the spot that you injected.  A good way to
do this is use a little round bandage and put it over the 
spot.  This helps prevent you from injecting in the same spot,
and spacing the sites out accuartely (about 1 1/2 "" apart.)

This is from experience, so I hope it'll help you.  (I have
diabetes and have to take an injection every morning.)

Iridology is descendant from a 19th-century theory which mapped certain
diseases to sectors of the iris of the eye.  There's enough natural
variation in color that a skilled examiner can find indicators of
virtually any disease.

Modern scientists consider it to be complete bunk.

I'm not sure there's a really sharp distinction between allergic and
vasomotor rhinitis.  Basically, vasomotor rhinitis means your nose is
stuffy when it has no reason to be (not even an identifiable allergy).

Decongestants and steroid sprays work for vasomotor rhinitis.  Also,
I can get surprising relief from purely superficial measures such as
saline moisturizing spray and moisturizing gel.

Hi,

   I've just built a valve preamp and use a diode/capacitor
voltage multiplier to step the 12vAC supply voltage up to approx 
260vDV. As the load resistance increases, the RC constant decreases
and hence the output voltage drops. I need as high an output
voltage as possible. (about 260v).
  The circuit consists of seven voltage multiplier stages
(ie 14 diodes and 14 capacitors) each capacitor develops about 38v
across them, and I take the output from across seven capacitors=260v.
  Each capacitor is 100mfd at 68v.
 If I increase each of the capacitors rating (220-470mfd), that will
increase the RC constant, and hence alleviate some of the problem.
These capacitors are going to be a little expensive as I need 14 of
them, So:

1. What would happen if I connected a 470mfd at 400v capacitor in parallel 
with the output (and hence in parallel with the seven 100mfd capacitors)?
  Will it, as I assume, increase the C in circuit and hence increase
the RC time constant? If it does, and my output voltage becomes more
stable by doing this, then I will have killed two birds with one stone...
as I am experiencing some 50Hz ripple (and hence amp hum), and this new
capacitor will 'smooth' this out.

and
2. Can anyone recomend a suitable value for an inductor (choke) to
be placed in the output line of the power supply to filter out
the 50Hz mains hum. Lowest resistance possible !

  I've not got my preamp with me at the moment because it is TOO MUCH
of a distraction.... (I'm at university and I've got to get my 
dissertation finished in two weeks !!!!!!!) hence I'm mailing not
playing with my solderoing iron (it'll be cheaper too in the long
run... especially if 14 new large capacitors don't work as planned!)

Email please.... Can't always read the net.....

Thanks in advance..

 Marty, I personally wouldn't be so quick and take that NEJM article 
 on kidney stones as gospel. First of all, I would want to know who
 sponsored that study.
 I have seen too many ""nutrition"" bulletins over the years from
 local newspapers, magazines, to TV-guide, with disclaimers on the
 bottom informing us that this great health news was brought to us
 compliments of the Dairy Industries.
 There are of course numerous other interest groups now that thrive
 financially on the media hype created from the supposedly enormous 
 benefits of increasing one's calcium intake.

 Secondly, were ALL the kidney stones of the test subjects involved 
 in that project analysed for their chemical composition?  The study
 didn't say that, it only claimed that ""most kidney stones are large-
 ly calcium.""
 Perhaps it won't be long before another study comes up with the exact
 opposite findings. A curious phenomenon with researchers is that they
 are oftentimes just plain wrong. It wouldn't be the first time.
 
 Sodium/magnesium/calcium/phosphorus ratios are, in my opinion, still 
 the most reliable indicators for the cause, treatment, and prevention 
 of kidney stones.
 I, for one, will continue to recommend the most logical changes in
 one's diet or through supplementation to counteract or prevent kidney
 stones of either type; and they definitely won't include an INCREASE
 in calcium if the stones have been identified as being of the calcium
 type and people's chemical analysis confirms that they would benefit
 from a PHOSPHORUS-raising approach instead!

Keywords: Motorola, FPU, 68882, 68030, 33/50 MHz, problems (FPU exception)
News-Software: VAX/VMS VNEWS 1.41    

I just installed a Motorola XC68882RC50 FPU in an Amiga A2630 board (25 MHz
68030 + 68882 with capability to clock the FPU separately).  Previously
a MC68882RC25 was installed and everything was working perfectly.  Now the
systems displays a yellow screen (indicating a exception) when it check for
the presence/type of FPU.  When I reinstall an MC68882RC25 the system works
fine, but with the XC68882 even at 25 MHz it does not work.  The designer
of the board mentioned that putting a pullup resistor on data_strobe (470 Ohm)
might help, but that didn't change anything.  Does anybody have some
suggestions what I could do?  Does this look like a CPU-FPU communications
problem or is the particular chip dead (it is a pull, not new)?
Moreover, the place I bought it from is sending me an XC68882RC33.  I thought
that the 68882RC33 were labeled MC not XC (for not finalized mask design). 
Are there any MC68882RC33?

Thanks

OK, I've asked this before, and with a new thread on these lines, I
ask this again:

1: If a large hole current is run thru a resistor, will there be
   I^2 * R cooling instead of heating?

2: Can anyone design an amplifier that preferentially amplifies
   hole currents over normal electron currents?

3: what semiconductor materials have the highest ratio of
   hole mobility to electron mobility? (please quote actual
   test samples rather than estimates based on theory. Also,
   don't be limited to semiconductors: consider also insulators,
   resistors, dielectrics, piezo-electrics, conductors,
   magnets (metal, ceramic), magnetostrictives, etc).

NOTES:

   to summarize, this thread has so far stated that the only area
   where holes are not detectable is the vacuum. That is, hole
   particles only exist in the presence of matter.
   Previous threads have stated that holes only exist in certain
   semi-conductors. The question that naturally arises is if
   the hole currents inside a semi-conductor vanish at the point
   where the semiconductor is joined to a conductor (say, copper).
   I don't want a theoretical discussion here about whether
   holes could exist inside metal conductors, rather I ask for
   an experimental discussion on how to amplify and detect such
   currents *if* they exist.
   Also note that I have cross-posted this to sci.electronics
   since this is now becoming an electronic discussion.

Thanx,
Eric.

I own the Adcom 60W power amp.  As far as I'm concerned, there's no
  amp which can touch it at the price range.
The build quality is very impressive and is far superior to other 
  amps in the price range.  The whole amplifier is extremely solid
  with massive heat sinks and very solid casing.
If you open the amp up, there are only very good quality components 
  in and the amp seems to be designed extremely well.  Perfect
  symmetry for both channels and TWO transformers - one for each
  channel.  The binding posts on the back of the amplifier are
  virtually the same as those on the Classe model 70 ie. very good.

I was also sceptical about the amps being built in the far-east
  or where-ever.  But if you look in the amp and see what components
  they use and how it was designed, you can easily see why the
  amplifiers sound so brilliant.
I cannot see why people say the amplifier won't last - not with
  those quality components inside.  Sure the amp runs very fairly
  hot - but that's how you get an amp to sound incredibly good.

My last point, I recently auditioned the Adcom preamp something like
  the 545 or something.  It was two years old and it still sounded
  like new.

If you build an amplifier decently, like the Adcom's, they will
  sound brilliant and last a long time - period.

Just my thoughts, but then - I do own one of Adcom's amps.

Paul,

Unfortunately, there are not too many retail outlets that'll stock
just about every chip made.  The stuff they will stock are the ones
that'll sell, like standard DRAM's, 80386's, 68000's, etc,etc.
i.e.  I cna't think of any 'one-stop-shopping' store.

The closest you can get is to pick up a copy of Byte magazine or
the Circuit Cellar, Popular Electronics, and the like and flip
through them.

Distributors like Wyle Electronics, Hamilton Avnet, Pioneer Electronics,
etc, etc, don't normally deal with end-users like ourselves where
we only a couple of everything...they only deal with people who buy
by the hundreds or more.  Each distributor represents and sells a variety of
different non-competing manufacturers.  What do I mean by this?
Suppose ABC Electronics sells Intel 80386's.  It's a pretty good
bet that they won't be selling any of AMD's 386's, or vice-versa.
They also can obtain just about *any* chip you want from a manufacturer
they represent.

Who knows?  You might be lucky to be able to buy from one of them.
But I'd be suprised if you do.  ALso bear in mind that the 1 or 2
qty prices they will charge you will be *much* greater than what
a mail order outlet will charge.

My advice?  If you're gonna be designing anything, try to stick
with off-the-shelf stuff.  You're going to get stuck if you use
too many esoteric parts sooner or later.

good luck,

aaron

Aaahh... a problem very near and dear to my heart. In our case, other
monitors cause this problem - the deflection coil of other monitors to be
specific. Have also seen a monitor backed up to a fuse panel exhibit this
problem. This sounds like your problem since flourescent lites, motors, etc
several 10s of feet away seem to me to be too far to cause it, but the
juice running to them must pass nearby your monitor. Fusebox on other side
of wall maybe?
We started spec'ing Panasonic CT-1331Y video monitors (3 switchable input
lines(vid & aud) S-VHS on one) <$400. This stopped the wavy interference
effect on the computer monitor next to it. 
Now on to your problem. You need what is known as mu shielding (very
common, in fact almost mandatory on electrostatic deflection type
O'scopes).
I talked to a EE prof. He said get a coffee can, cut both ends off, mount
around deflection coil of interfering monitor. 
BE CAREFUL TO AVOID ALL HIGH VOLTAGE CIRCUITRY. ESPECIALLY THE THICKER HIGH
VOLTAGE ANODE LEAD USUALLY COLORED RED. IF YOU KILL YOURSELF, DON'T
BLAME/SUE ME!!! USE PLASTIC OR OTHER NON-CONDUCTING STAND-OFFS AND SUCH TO
MOUNT CAN.
Now, I would assume that what is good for keeping mag fields in is also
good at keeping them out, so hopefully this'll work by mounting shield on
monitor being interfered with as well. If not, start shielding those other
sources.

Do you believe that any quacks exist?  How about quack diagnoses?  Is
being a ""licensed physician"" enough to guarantee that someone is not
a quack, or is it just that even if a licensed physician is a quack,
other people shouldn't say so?  Can you give an example of a
commonly diagnosed ailment that you think is a quack diagnosis,
or have we gotten to the point in civilization where we no longer
need to worry about unscrupulous ""healers"" taking advantage of
people.

No, they do not work well.  My doctor started using one recently, and I
thought the concept was so amazing that I bought one too.  

The thing works by reading the infrared emissions from the ear drum.
The ear drum is hotter than the ear canal walls, so you have to point
the thing very carefully.  This means tugging on the top of the ear
to straighten out the ear canal, then inserting the thing snugly, then
pushing a button.  Unfortunately, there are many things that can go wrong.
It is almost impossible to aim the thing correctly when you do it on 
yourself.  I get readings which differ from each other by up to 2 degrees,
and may differ from an oral thermometer by up to 2 degrees.  

I talked to one of the nurses in my doctor's office recently about this,
and she said she didn't like them either, for same reasons.  She did give
me some instruction on how to tug on my ear, and what correct insertion
feels like, but she said she thought it was impossible to do correctly
on one's self.  She also said that she and other nurses had complained to
the company about inaccurate readings, and that someone from the company
had told them to take great care to clean the infrared window at the end
of the probe with alcohol from time to time.  She demonstrated this prior
to reading my temperature, and managed to get a reading within 0.5 degree
of the oral temperature I took at home before driving to the Dr's office.

I have also noticed tha some nurses click the button, then remove the
probe immediately.  This causes wrong readings.  In my experience, you
have to leave the probe in a good 1 to 2 seconds after clicking the button
to get a good measurement.  The nurse I talked with agreed.  I suspect
that many people don't realize this, and therefore get bad readings for
yet another reason.

In short, it's a great idea.  It may work for some folks, but I believe
it doesn't work well for a person who wants to take his own temperature.

When the utility gave up on that Cinnci, OH plant (Zimmer?) and
announced they were going to convert it to a coal-fired scheme, the
turbines were already in place, and they were the low-temp type. So the
plan was: Install a SECOND set of high temp turbines, and feed the
low-temp ones with the output of the new ones.

Never saw anything more on this. Did they ever really build it?

From what I have read about these little gadgets, it works on
a electrochemical galvanic principle. The sensing unit has a
chemical matrix which produces an electrical voltage proportional
to the amount of chemical compound it is designed for ... in this case
I believe it is the Hydroxyl group???  

I have also heard -  not tested :-)  - since common gasoline is also
a member of this Hydroxyl group, it will also cause a failing breathalizer
failure! Next time you get stopped for DUI, say you just siphoned gas from

    as a point of info, some of the early nuclear power plants in this
country used the fission pile as a first stage to get the water hot, and
then had a second stage -fossil fuel- step to get the water (actually
steam) VERY HOT.

   I remember seeing this at Con Edison's Indian Point #1 power plant,
which is about 30 miles north of NYC, and built more or less 1958.

Not hard, you can do the refreshing and access cycles by software, but
this hogs most of the available CPU cycles on a low-end controller.
I've seen some application note from Philips that used one of their
8051 derivatives as a printer buffer, with up to 1MB of dynamic ram
that was accessed and refreshed with software bit-banging.

Another alternative would be to use one of those nice DRAM controller
chips that ""create static RAM appearance"" and all that, but they may
be too expensive to make it worthwhile.

I second what Spenser Aden said in reply.  Additionally, it is hard to say
what type of response you ar3e having to prednisone since you did not say
how long you have been on it.  Patients are generally kept on steroids for
months before thinking about tapering.  Alternatives to daily dosing are 
every other day dosing, in your case 20mg every other day would be a start.
Another option if it is not possible to get you off prednisone is to start
azathioprine.  Like Spenser said, you should generally be on another drug
in addition to your prednisone, like asulfidine.  A lot of the specifics
about options, though, depends on severity, location, and duration of 
disease, as well as histology, so take advice off the net for what it
is worth.  

I treat patients with UC and Crohn's.  An educated patient is a good 
patient, but let your doctor know where the advice came from so things
can be put in context.  You should also be a member of the Crohn's and
Colitis Foundation of America.  1-800-932-2423 office / 1-800-343-3637

thermoelement,etc) work the better, the bigger the temperature difference  
between input and output is. Because You never get all thermic energy out of  
the powering medium (steam, burning gaz, etc), You have to eliminate the rest  
of the energy to keep the efficency high. A thermal electric power plant (coal,  
oil or atomic power) works just the same way. You heat water (steam) to power  
the turbine and generators. Because You don't get the whole energy out of the  
steam (efficency is never 100%) You have to cool down this steam again by  
something else. Most power plants use cooling towers for this purpose (some  
type of mega-refrigerator...). Others use water of a river (ecologically not  
unobjectionable). Got it ?

What is happening is this:
1) You turn the TV on.
2) The horizontal output begins normal operation.  This powers up the
   high voltage and most of the rest of the circuitry.
3) A problem is sensed and the horizontal oscillator shuts down.
4) After it powers down the cycle repeats.

Things to check:
First check for a shorted high power component.  Your best bet is the vertical
output transistor(s) or, if there is one, the voltage regulator.  The most
common cause of this type of failure is too much current being drawn
somewhere.
Also look for shutdown circuits (which your TV may or may not have),
if you can find one that is shutting down the horizontal oscillator
then it shouldn't be too hard to find the problem from there.

I was having a look through a couple of components catalogues when I
came across a range of Peltier Effect heat pumps intended for cooling
components.  For those who have not heard of this effect, you put a
current through one of these devices, and it pumps heat from one side
to the other.  Reverse the current and you reverse the effect.  I
think a temperature difference can give you an EMF as well.

Anyway, it struck me that you could make a nice cool/hot box for
picnics with one of these, a power regulator, a thermostat and a
couple of heat sinks.  The biggest device can shift 60W with an
efficiency of 80-90%, which ain't bad (although it would flatten my
car battery in about half an hour).

Unfortunately the catalogue didn't list anything more than the basic
specs as a heat pump.  I imagine that you would get a back-EMF as the
temperature gradient across the device increases.  If so, presumably
its power decreases as the back-EMF increases, until eventually we
have a steady state with no current being consumed (assuming no
leakage).  If so, then the final temperature difference between the
two sides could be set by the supply voltage and nothing more
(although that would be a lousy way to control it).

What I would like to know is:

1: Are the above guesses correct?

2: What is the open-circuit thermal resistance of a typical device?
   (I just want to be sure that my coolbox is not going to get warm
   too fast when I unplug it)

3: How does a Peltier Effect heat pump actually work?  It looks like
   magic!

4: Why don't they use these things in domestic fridges/freezers?

A friend of mine is going in later this week for tests to see if has
emphysema.  His lung capacity has decreased over time.  His father died
of the disease.  He works in woodworking.  I believe he has a very
occasional cigarette, perhaps one cigarette a day or even less.  He tells
me this..I've never seen him light up.  He has some pretty healthy
life style habits, good diet, exercise, meditation, retreats, therapy
etc.  Anyhow..he is very concerned with this check up.  I know really
nothing about the disease.  I believe it interferes with the lining
of the lung being able to exchange oxygen.  

Is a diagnosis of emphysema a death sentence?  If he were to give up smoking
entirely would that better his chances for recovery?  What are some 
modern therapies used in people with this disease?  I would appreciate 
any information.  Thanks.  amigan@cup.portal.com

and pins on the bottom that looks like it would plug into the ][+ motherboard
somewhere after pulling a chip.  There's an empty socket also on the interface
card and a short 16-pin DIP jumper like the ones used with ][+ language cards.
 
This technological marvel came with no docs and I haven't a clue as how to hook
this thing up.  If anyone has docs and/or users disk of any sort for this I

The ground-lift switch disconnects the GND line from the mixer. The
transformer ratio depends on the precise application, but around 10:1
turns ratio may be a good place to start.

   Well, if that's the case in YOUR practice, I have a hard time 
   figuring out how you even managed to make it into the bottom half
   of your class, or did you create your diplomas with crayons?
 
   If someone runs a medical practice with only a 10% success rate,
   they either tackle problems for which they are not qualified to
   treat, or they have no conscience and are only in business for
   fraudulent purposes.

   OTOH, who are we kidding, the New England Medical Journal in 1984
   ran the heading: ""Ninety Percent of Diseases are not Treatable by
   Drugs or Surgery,"" which has been echoed by several other reports.
   No wonder MDs are not amused with alternative medicine, since
   the 20% magic of the ""placebo effect"" would award alternative 
   practitioners twice the success rate of conventional medicine...

No, he does not exclusively treat LD patients.  However, in some parts of the
country, you don't need to be known as an LD ""specialist"" to see a large
number of LD patients walk through your office.  Given the huge problem of
underdiagnosis, orthopedists encounter late manifestations of the disease just
about every day in their regular practices.  Dr. N. told me that last year,
he sent between 2 and 5 patients a week to the LD specialists... and he is not
the only orthopedists in the town.

Let's say that only 2 people per week actually have LD.  That means at the
*very minimum* 104 people in our town (and immediate area) develop late stage
manifestations of LD *every year*.  Add in the folks who were diagnosed by
neurologists, rheumatologists, GPs, etc, and you can see what kind of problem
we have.  No wonder just about everybody in town personally knows an LD
patient.

He refers most patients to LD specialists, but in extreme cases he puts the
patient on medication immediately to minimize the damage (in most cases, to
the knees).

Gordon is correct when he states that most LD specialists are GPs.

Here's a question for all you electrical engineers out there:

  I bought an 'Infrared detector module' at Radio Shack for $3.95 - it is a 
little gizmo that senses infrared remotes and produces an output signal. Then
I hooked the output through a transistor to an infrared LED. The circuit works
like a minature remote control extender in my car - All remote commands are
relayed to the CD player hidden in the glove compartment. It works fine with
my Denon CD player, but when I tried to build the same circuit for a friend's
VCR, it didn't work.
  The circuit appears to work for other remotes (you can see infrared with a
Sony CCD camcorder) but coincidentally it only seems to work for my CD
player...

	Any advice would be appreciated....

Well, I'm not sure I'd use this to process a guitar but there was a audio
filter DSP construction article in the Sept 92 issue of QST magazine (Ham Radio
oriented).  The DSP is available in kit form for about $120.

This particular DSP filter was targetted toward processing audio to remove
noise (static).  I built it and it really works well.  The source code is
available too.  It makes a noisy audio signal much easier to hear.  Note that
this is for communication applications and is not ""high fidelity"".

Bob is indeed correct here in more than one way. A look in the old
RCA picture tube manual backs this up, as does SAMS Reference Data
handbook. The internal coating around the perimeter of the CRT
(not the aluminum or tin CRT face coating) is referred to as a
""dag"" as well as the outer coating.

Thankfully, I didn't need to go to a f****** library to find it, either.

I was part of a study a few years ago at the University of Arizona to
see whether cross dominant individuals (those with a particular handedness
but who had dominance in the opposite eye) were better hitters than
those with same side dominance of hand and eye.  I was picked from
my softball class because I was cross dominant (right hand, left eye)
which put me in a small minority (and the grad student was trying to get
an equal number of cross dominant and same side dominant people).  To
control the study, she used a pitching machine - fast pitch.  Since
I was used to slow pitch, I didn't come close (actually I think
I foul tipped a few) to hitting the ball.  If there were a lot of people
like me in her study (i.e., those who can't hit fast pitch, or are
not used to hitting off a machine),  I would seriously question the
results of that study!!  I think there have been some studies of major
league players (across a fairly large cross section of players) to test
whether eye dominance being the same or opposite side was ""better"" -
but I don't know the results.  (The woman who ran the study I was in
said that there was a higher incidence of crossdominance in major
leaguers than across the general population - but I'm not sure
whether I'd believe her.)

means of a transformer. The secondary current will be .6 A (600 mA).

What kind of transformer should I use (ferrite?)
Can I buy one? If so, I need a partnumber and supplier
If I cannot buy one, how do I go about winding one myself?
What core do I use, how big must it be in order not to saturate,
what thickness copper wire, how many turns, etc.?

I know little about analog electronics, so I hope some kind
soul here will help me out.
Pointers to relevant databooks will also be highly appreciated.

Thanks,

NASA and related agencies apparently used this same principles to create
the loudest reported reproduced sound. They used an ""analog"" electrically
controlled valve to control the flow of air across a horn throat. If I 
remember correctly it was called a ""modulated air blast transducer"". There
were reports of the thing being able to produce 106 dB @ 80 Hz @ 10 mile
distance, communicate directly with fighter pilots @ 5000 ft, etc.

I would like to be able to detect the angular position (low accuracy) of an
IR emitting source at a distance of about 100 meters (more is better) in
daylight.  The IR source could be emitting a signature; I'm leaning toward
30 KHz square wave with 50% duty cycle.

I am considering the use of a quadrant detector from Centronic Inc. to give
information to a pan/tilt head to point the sensor and thus determine the
angles.  For the source I am considering wazing the heck out of an IR LED(s),
possibly an Optek OP290 or Motorola MLED81.  Wazing would mean at least 1 Amp
current pulses.  At this current the duty cycle of the LED drops to 10% and I
would need to cycle five of them in turn to get the 50% required.

Has anyone done something like this?

Mixers have a wide variety of implementations; the Mini-Circuits
part you mention is a doubly-balanced diode mixer, but active ones
(BJT, FET) seem more popular in consumer receivers.  You might
call MCL; they have a nice catalog.

The universal answer for wide-coverage, theory+practice, RF design
is the _ARRL Handbook_, published by the American Radio Relay
League, the radio amateur organization.  Any technical bookstore
can order you one.  The book is superb, with lots of accessible
theory, construction projects, and generally interesting stuff.

You might also check out _Solid State Design for the Radio Amateur_
(I think), by Hayward and <someone>.  This has sharper design
and test information about subsystems like mixers.

Last week I asked for help in getting an old homemade amp working with
my Sun CD-ROM drive. It turns out that the channel I was testing with
was burned out in the amp. The other channel works fine.

So now I need a new amplifier chip. My local Radio Shack no longer
carries components! The chip is a 12 pin SIP (?) labelled with BA5406
and then ""502 515"" below that.

Does anyone have a source? Thanks,

Perhaps diluting the rubbing alcohol in some water, until you

               ( ALTERNATIVE Heavy Element Creation in Universe ) 

               A very simple experiment can demonstrate (PROVE) the 
          FACT of ""BIOLOGICAL TRANSMUTATIONS"" (reactions like Mg + O 
          --> Ca, Si + C --> Ca, K + H --> Ca, N2 --> CO, etc.), as 
          described in the BOOK ""Biological Transmutations"" by Louis 
          Kervran, [1972 Edition is BEST.], and in Chapter 17 of the 
          book ""THE SECRET LIFE OF PLANTS"" by Peter Tompkins and 
          Christopher Bird, 1973: 

               (1) Obtain a good sample of plant seeds, all of the same 
                   kind.  [Some kinds might work better that others.]

               (2) Divide the sample into two groups of equal weight 
                   and number.

               (3) Sprout one group in distilled water on filter paper 
                   for three or four weeks.

               (4) Separately incinerate both groups.

               (5) Weigh the residue from each group.  [The residue of 
                   the sprouted group will usually weigh at least 
                   SEVERAL PERCENT MORE than the other group.]

               (6) Analyze quantitatively the residue of each group for 
                   mineral content.  [Some of the mineral atoms of the 
                   sprouted group have been TRANSMUTED into heavier 
                   mineral elements by FUSING with atoms of oxygen, 
                   hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, etc..]

          
               BIOLOGICAL TRANSMUTATIONS occur ROUTINELY, even in our 
          own bodies. 
          
               Ingesting a source of organic silicon (silicon with 
          carbon, such as ""horsetail"" extract, or radishes) can SPEED 
          HEALING OF BROKEN BONES via the reaction Si + C --> Ca, (much 
          faster than by merely ingesting the calcium directly).  
          
               Some MINERAL DEPOSITS in the ground are formed by micro-
          organisms FUSING together atoms of silicon, carbon, nitrogen, 
          oxygen, hydrogen, etc.. 
          
               The two reactions Si + C <--> Ca, by micro-organisms, 
          cause ""STONE SICKNESS"" in statues, building bricks, etc..  
          
               The reaction N2 --> CO, catalysed by very hot iron, 
          creates a CARBON-MONOXIDE POISON HAZARD for welder operators 
          and people near woodstoves (even properly sealed ones). 
          
               Some bacteria can even NEUTRALIZE RADIOACTIVITY!

I've had very good results from the SSM2016 from PMI (part of Analogue
Devices). They have also now introduced the SSM2017 which looks good on
paper, but which I haven't tried yet.

There is a mini-epidemic of Coccidiodes that is occurring in,
I believe, the Owen's Valley/ Bishop area east of the Sierras.
I don't believe there has been any great insight into the
increased incidence in that area. There is a low-level
of endemic infection in that region. Many people with
evidence of past exposure to the organism did not have
serious disease.

Indeed, an extreme example.  It came ""out of nowhere.""  The connection
Kekule saw between it and his problem is fortunate but not extraordinary.
I, for example, often receive/conjure solutions (hypotheses for solutions) 
to my everyday problems at moments when I appear to myself to be occupied 
with activities quite removed.  Algorithms for that new software feature come
when I trample the meadow on my occasional runs.  Alternative (better>) ways 
to instruct and rear my sons arrive while I weed the garden.  I'll swear I am 
not thinking about any of it when ideas come.   

These ideas are not the stuff of ""great"" discoveries, of course, but my
connecting them to particular problems is fraught with deliberation and
occasional fits of rationality.

Yes.  And he was lucky to have such a colorful, vivid image.  I, alas, will

For your information:

I hooked up my ImageWriter I to my COM1 serial port and used the C-Itoh
8510 driver in Windows 3.1.  The cable I am using is a straight-thru
cable connected to a Null Modem Adapter I got at Radio Shack (catalog
#26-1496a) for $4.95.  It seems to work fine with both DOS and Windows.
I used the following command in DOS

	C:\DOS\mode COM1:9600,n,8,1,p

and set up the port the same way in the Windows Ports setup.

the Null Modem connections are as follows:

	1	to	1
	2	to	3
	3	to	2
	4	to	5
	5	to	4
	6+8	to	20
	20	to	6+8
	7	to	7

I printed from several applications and all seems OK.

Perhaps you're using the wrong brand! (Sorry all HP fans, but I have
a hard time being convinced that their scopes match the rest of their
(excellent) gear).

One of the principal functions I look for when considering a DSO is
whether you can turn interpolation off. The other important feature
is to disable repetitive waveform acquisition i.e. being able to lock
the instrument into real time capture mode.

I agree with you here. The only consolation is that manufacturers are
_beginning_ to pay attention to ergonomics when designing the menus.
However, to be fair, it seems that first time scope users (our students)
seem to adjust to menus easier than navigating around the twenty or
more knobs required of a ""real"" scope :-)

This is one area that newer DSOs are addressing. I recently evaluated
the latest box from Tek - their TDS320 - which seems to be a worthy
alternative to a standard 100MHz analogue CRO. This instrument has
a 100MHz, 500Ms/s spec, meaning that it is _always_ in real time
capture mode. The pricing also matches equivalent analogue scopes in
the range. The downer is that the instrument uses menus again, but at
least they appear to be logically laid out.

One more thing about the new, ""simpler"", front panels. These instruments
tend to use digital rotary encoders as knobs now. This is a vast improvement
over the old oak switch. The single most common cause of failure in our
scopes (other than students blowing up inputs!) is mechanical wear on these
switches. I look at the new panels as a great step toward increasing the
longevity of the instruments.

Actually, severe headaches due to stopped up sinuses (plugged ostia) are
possible, and sinus surgery which widens the ostia - from the normal 2
mm to about 10 mm - should relieve this.  There are non-surgical ways,
however, to keep the ostia open (however, in a few individuals, their
ostia are naturally very small), and Dr. Ivker's book talks about this.
The underlying cause of chronic sinusitis is NOT cured by this kind of
sinus surgery, though.

About asthma, that's a little more controversial.  Dr. Ivker, in his book,
""Sinus Survival"", *speculates* (and says it's not proven), that many cases
of asthma are triggered by chronic sinusitis due to the excessive drainage
(postnasal drip) from the sinuses.  He's had many patients who've found
relief from asthma when the chronic sinusitis is reduced or eliminated -
not clinical proof, but compelling anecdotal information of this speculation.

Before doing any sinus surgery, first get THE BOOK - it discusses surgery,
as well as a good non-surgical treatment program for chronic sinusitis.

My opinion(for what it's worth) is that 40 x-rays is *way* too many.  
Guidleines have been set on the number of dental x-rays and chest x-rays 
that one should have over a given period of time because of all the 
environmental factors that can cause cancer in humans, ionizing radiation 
is one of the most potent(splits DNA and causes hydroxyl free radical 
formation in tissue cells).  Ultasound(like that used in seeing the fetus 
in the uterus) has been shown to be extremely good at picking up tumors 
in the prostate and gallstones in the gallbladder.  But kidney tissue may 
be too dense for ultrasound to work for kidney stones(any radiologists care 
to comment?).

Most stones will pass(but it's a very painful process).  Unlike gallstones, 
I don't think that there are many drugs that can help ""dissolve"" the 
kidney stone(which is probably calcium-oxalate).  Vitamin C and magnesium 
have worked in rabbits to remove calcium from calcified plaques in the 
aterial wall.  I have no idea if a diet change or supplementation could 
speed up the process of kidney stone passage(but I'm pretty confident that 
a diet change and/or supplementation can prevent a reoccurance).  If surgery 
is being contemplated, the stone must be in the kidney tubule.  A second 
opinion is a good idea because there are better(less damaging) ways to break 
up the stone if it's logged within the kidney(sonic blasts).  HMO's are 
notorious for conservative care and long waits for expensvie treatments.  
My condolences to your friend.

No, it is independent of the speedometer. The gun processes two doppler
returns--the speed of the car relative to the pavement and the speed
of the target, taking the difference between the two. Some guns with
a ""moving mode"" actually have a split beam with one beam aimed
preferentially at the pavement.

Car and Driver had a good article on traffic radar, but it was back in
1985. I used its contents and references to defend myself against a bogus
radar-measured ticket. It detailed ""moving mode,"" which is easier to
defend against because of the increased amount of variables.

  What you describe is very close to what I built and described in the
10th ARRL Computer Network Conference proceedings.

  I built 10 watt FSK transceivers at 904 MHz.  They are essentially
double conversion transverters with digital mod and demod at 29 MHz.
The receiver uses the MC13055 which is the same FSK receiver chip I used
previouslyu in the 2 Mbps 10 GHz data link I first published in Ham
Radio and which is now also in the ARRL handbook.

  The MC3356, which includes a VHF converter section, could also be used
at these speeds.  There is a newer and perhaps slightly improved design
of this (the MC13056 if I remember rightly).

  While using this would have let me reduce the ""external"" IF count on
receive, it didn't really offer all that much help on transmit so I
didn't bother with it.

  The radios I built were first designed and built for 512 kbps in a 2
MHz channel but later reduced to half that.  These 256 kbps radios
actually have done quite well in across-the-bench tests at 384 kbps and
speed is pretty much a function of filter design.  Handling the data
stream is another matter entirely.

  Some of the existing radios are currently deployed on hilltops in a
""beacon"" test mode.  While there is not yet end-end two-way data flow
due to lack of resources to debug software for the digital hardware (MIO
also shown in the CNC proceedings), data is perfect copy at n6gn.  Even
though the data clock is currently at about half speed, the a 2+ kbytes
of the test text (chapter 55 of Isaiah) takes only a little over 1/8 of
a second.

  I've been hoping that someone would get interested enough to step in

  If anyone in the SF bay area wants to check it out there is also a CW

Mtn and Black Mtn (overlooking Si valley).  The antenna is horizontally
polarized.

  I guess in retrospect my suggestions are that this is a fairly costly
approach if the radios are intended for users rather than backbones and
you might want to carefully consider your ""target"".  If you can't
arrange your paths such that you have complete line-of-sight I think
you'll want to address the inter-symbol-interference caused by
multipath and probably link C/N budgets if paths are very far from LOS.
For more details, see the 10th CNC.  I'm currently working on a spread
spectrum, direct conversion design to address some of these problems.
I'd be glad to help as I can with any design problems.

	A friend has the following symptoms which have occurred periodically
every few months for the last 3 years.  An episode begins with extreme
tiredness followed by:

	1. traveling joint pains and stiffness affecting mostly the elbows,
	knees, and hips.
	2. generalized muscle pains
	3. tinnitus and a feeling of pressure in her ears
	4. severe sweating occuring both at night and during the day
	5. hemorrhaging in both eyes.  Her opthamologist calls it peripheral
   retinal hemorhages and says it looks similar to diabetic retinopathy.  (She
        isn't diabetic--they checked.
	6. distorted color vision and distorted vision in general (telephone
	   poles do not appear to be straight)
	7. loss of peripheral vision.
 	
	Many tests have been run and all are normal except for something 
called unidentified bright objects found on a MRI of her brain.  The only
thing that seems to alleviate one of these episodes is prednisone.  At
times she had been on 60 mg per day.  Whenever she gets down to 10-15 mg
the symptoms become acute again.

	She is quite concerned because the retinal hemorrhages are becoming
worse with each episode and her vision is suffering.  None of the docs she
has seen have any idea what this condition is or what can be done to stop
it.  Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in

Check out Xicor's new goodie in the April 12th edition of EETimes
X88C64 - an 8k * 8 E2PROM with built in latch AND bootloader setup.
You hook it directly to your '51, power it up, the prom initialises the
serial port on the '51, you load in your code via RXD, this gets blatted
onto the E2PROM, then you reset and run - i'm sure Dallas also does
something like this too, i suppose it would boil down to relative
prices, and the Dallas part freeing up P0 & P2 completely. I wonder
if ANYONE has ever managed to design a single sided PCB with an
8051, 573, EPROM, SRAM and >>NO LINKS<< ?

I have become involved in a project to further develop and 
improve the performance of SPECT (Single Photon Emission
Computerized Tomography) imaging.  We will eventually have
to peddle this stuff somewhere, and so as I move this thing
along, I would like to know --

What is the current resolution of SPECT imaging?  What kinds
of jobs is SPECT used for, specifically?  What kind of specific jobs
could I hope
that SPECT could be used for, if its resolution improved,
say, to close to that of PET (Positron Emission Tomography)?
And how much does a SPECT machine cost?  How much does a single

If anyone knows the answer to any or all of these questions, OR

Sure, you've already got the right idea.

Ignoring the 50 ohm internal resistance of the generator for a second, just
run it into, say, a voltage divider made of 990 ohms in series with 10
ohms.  This new circuit is the Thevenin equivalent of one that puts out
1/100 of the original voltage, and has an output impedence of negligibly
less than 10 ohms.  You may want to monkey with the values a little
depending on whether you care more about the _exact_ dividing ratio or
the availability of parts.

Hows that sound?

P.S. -- This is why those 1000:1 high voltage probes for multimeters can be
accurate but still cheap.  They have something like 100 megs in series with
100k, which doesn't load the (often high impedence) source much, as well as
keeping the (probably 10 meg impedance) multimeter happy.

Or: Get an 8-bit DA-Converter (merely a couple of transistors and
Resistors) and an OpAmp to compare its output to the voltage you want to
measure, connect them to a spared printer port (if you have one), and do
the rest by software (stepwise refinement). The port addresses for your

well enough for your purposes.

	Serum, actually, but plasma numbers are the same.  Whole blood

	Indeed, they do measure whole blood levels, although they are not
	as accurate as a serum test done in a laboratory.  One problem is
	that cells in the sample continue to metabolize glucose after the
	sample is drawn, reducing the apparent level.  According to Teitz,
	however, results compare ""reasonably well"" with laboratory results,
	although ""values below 80 mg./dL. tend to be lower with strip tests,
	whereas values above 240 mg./dL. can be very erratic.""

>What is the conversion factor between human plasma glucose and

	As stated above, whole blood levels tend to be roughly 5 to 10 
	percent lower than serum levels.  Sample freshness will affect
	whole blood levels, however.  I don't believe there is a well-
	defined ""conversion factor,"" since cell metabolism will affect

	preferred for any except general ""ball park"" testing.

Actually, it's a bit more complicated than that...I sounds to me,
your UPS takes in AC, rectifies it to DC to charge the batteries, and
then takes the battery DC and chops it to AC again, feeding your
equipment.  This approach is the easiest and cleanest way to
switchover from the mains to battery once your power kicks out since,
as you mentioned, nothing will know about what happened down the line.

Another way to do the UPS scheme is to use the mains until you
lose power, and then kick in the battery backup with it's inverter to
replace the lost power.  The problem here is the switchover time and
you've got to resync the AC in no time flat.

Unfortunately, most everything is built around the assumption that
AC is available, so the UPS guys have to provide and AC output to
be usable...ya sorta have to make it work with what there already.

Similar story with our telephone system.  It was first invented back
in the 1800's.  We're still using the same damn system (media) as they
did back then.  If I have a phone from back then, I can assure you
it'll work on today's phone system.  It costs too much to overhaul
everyone to a new system, so they make it work with what is out there.

needed are as diverse as vacuum tubes to ICs (case with pins).
It also needs to have provision for adding legends to the

Outbreaks of a chronic-mono-like entity were originally called EBS (or
some variant thereof) because most of the people with this disease had
elevated levels of antibodies to the EBV virus. But not all of them
did, which prompted an official renaming of the disease to Chronic
Fatigue Syndrome (this renaming took place in the Annals of Internal
Medicine, Jan. 1988, I believe). Now it's also called Chronic Fatigue
and Immune Dysfunction Syndrome (CFIDS), since it seems clear that
some sort of immune disregulation is causing the probs.

Astonishly, there are still docs who tell people with massively
swollen glands, recurrent fevers and nightsweats, etc., that there's
nothing wrong with them. This is not the same thing as saying that the
syndrome may have a (at least partly) psychological cause. The
disagreement among people whose thoughts are worth considering centers
on just what the cause is. No one knows, but theories include:
psychological stress, some sort of virus (a retrovirus, say most --
maybe one of the newly discovered herpes viruses), environmental
toxins, bacteria (and, yes, candida), genes, (and/)or some combo of
these.

There's no outright cure at the moment, but different docs try
different things, some of which seem to help.

Massive amounts of info on the condition are available these days.
Post your Q to alt.med.cfs, and you will be flooded w/facts.

Note: There are lots of far better understood (and better treatable)
diseases that look like CFIDS. Make sure these get ruled-out by a good
doc.

Subject: Xmas light set with 2 levels of brightness

Another version of a variable brightness Xmas light set:
This set starts with a 2 blinker 35 bulb string.  

DIAGRAM:  orginal 2 way set

120v---+--b-*-*-*-*-*-*-*--!
       !---b-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-!
                           !
120rtn_____________________!

modified set for 2 level brightness:

                string 1
120v---------*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*--!
  \_10K_______*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-!
    5w    !      string 2     !
          b   ________________!
120v rtn__!___!

             ^ Note: no mods to wiring to the right of this point.

Only one blinker is used.

Note that the blinker would not have as much current thru it as the
string 1 bulbs, because of the second string of bulbs in
parallel with it.  That's why the use of the 10K 5W resistor
here to add extra current thru the blinker to make up for the
current shunted thru the second string while the blinker is glowing
and the second string is not glowing.  When the blinker goes open,
this resistor has only a slight effect on the brightness of the
strings, s1 slightly dimmer, s2 slightly brighter.  
Or use a 3W 120v bulb in place of the 10K resistor if you can get
one.  Caution, do not replace with a standard C9 bulb, as these
draw too much current and burn out the blinker.  C9 = approx 7W.

What you'll see when it's working:  powerup, string 1 will light 
at full brightness, and b will be lit, bypassing most of the current 
from the second string, making them not light.  b will open, placing 
both strings in series, making the string that was out to glow at a 
low brightness, and the other string that was on before to glow 
at reduced brightness. 

Be sure to wire and insulate the splices, resistor leads, and cut wires 
in a safe manner!

Anyway, I'd like to build a UV flashlight, cheaply. ""flashlight"" means
it should be reasonably portable, but could have a power pack if

My main question is the bulb: where can I get UV bulbs? Do they

I'm not too concerned with whether it's long-wave or short-wave

You'd have to purify the river water first.  I'm not sure how practical
that is with the Mississippi.  You'd better check with health agencies
along the way to see if there are toxic chemicals in the river.  If
it is just microorganisms, those can be filtered or killed, but you
may need activated charcoal or other means to purify from chemicals.
Better be same than sorry.  Obviously, drinking the river without
processing it is likely to make you sick from bacteria and parasites.

Umm, weren't you the one objecting to someone who is a ""licensed
physician"" being called a quack?  Or is it just that being a licensed
physician is a good defense against charges of quackery when the
physician agrees with your system of beliefs?

>Lately I've seen the word ""quack"" bandied about recklessly.

Actually, I almost never use the term quack.  When I discuss
""systemic yeast syndrome"", however, I always point out that
mainstream medicine views this as a quack diagnosis (and I agree
with that characterization).

>Let me put it another way to make my point clear:  ""quack"" is a nebulous word

Really?  I bet virtually everyone reading these posts understands what
Steve Dyer, Gordon Banks, and I am implying when we have talked about
systemic yeast syndrome as a quack diagnosis.  Would you prefer the
word ""charlatan""?  (I don't happen to think that all quacks are
charlatans since I suspect that some believe in the ""diseases"" they
are diagnosing.)

Why?  Is there some reason why you feel that it shouldn't be pointed out
in SCI.med that there is no convincing empirical evidence to support the 
existence of systemic yeast syndrome?

Recently, I completed a 2 week juice fast (with 3 days of water) and had
two colonics as part of it.  My motivation was primarily spiritual, to
de-toxify from all the crap I've been putting in my body (not like thats
enough to clean it all out but it did have an effect).  Personaly, I
didn't find it an uncomfortable experience (the colonic), lost about
15lbs of beer belly (which hasn't come back over the last month), and
feel great.  One of the things that prompted me to get the colonic was
seeing my 90 year old grandmother chair ridden from colitis (?) from
years of indulgence.

Not everything that goes in comes out, and personaly I don't mind giving
my body a hand once in a while.

My experience with the standard old zenith parallel port in their 
original 286s proves that.  They had the input direction disactiviated by 
tieing them R/W select line of the circuit to Vcc.  To make it bi ( which 
I did ) I had to modify it by scraping off the trace and solder a jump to

Yes,

Take Interstate I-70 to the route 48 exit.  Go south on 48 about
2-1/2 miles.  Trun right on Shiloh Springs Road.  The hamvention is
at the Harrah arena, which is about 1 mile west and on the north
side of the Road.  Parking at the arena is limited.  Lodging is
probably entirely booked-up within a 40 mile radius.  Good luck.

Reading this definition, I wonder: when should you recognize something

No, there's no evidence that would convince any but the most credulous.

The ""evidence"" is identical to the sort of evidence that has been
used to justify all sorts of quack treatments for quack diseases
in the past.

I like the implication here.  It must not be that the quacks making
millions off such ""diseases"" are biased -- rather that those who
doubt their existence don't understand the real world.  It seems
easy to picture a 19th centure snake oil salesman saying the same
thing.

However, I have been in the trenches long enough to have seen multiple
quack diseases rise and fall in popularity.  ""Systemic yeast syndome""
seems to be making a resurgence (it had fallen off a few years ago).
There will be new such ""diseases"" I'm sure with best-selling books
and expensive therapies.

I've got two lines coming into my apartment. Two different telephone numbers.
When I ordered the second line installed, instead of bringing out another 4
wire bundle, the telco just connected up to my yellow and black wires. So I
have one line on red & green and the other on yellow & black.

Today I was monitoring the voltage on both lines. I had a voltmeter across
the red and green and read back 52 volts. I then lifted up the receiver on my
second line.(black & yellow wires) The voltage dropped to 31 volts on the first
line. (red & green wires) I repeated this experiment with the second
line(monitoring black & yellow and lifting the handset off the cradle on the
red and green line.) It also dropped to 31 volts. 

Why is this ? I thought these were separate lines.

Next I went to the 66 block and disconnected the blue and white lines coming in
from the telco cable. I then disconnected all the phones in my apartment and
went back to the 66 block and did some resistance measurements. Both lines read
open.

I'll appreciate any help on this. Is this considered normal ?

We're looking at a series of chips by WSI, the PSD3xx series. They have

various RAM sizes (upto 16 K), and 19 I/O ports which can be chip select
lines, I/O or the buffered address lines.

I had a similar reaction to Chinese food but came to a completly different
conclusion. I've eaten Chinese food for ages and never had problems. I went
with some Chinese Malaysian friends to a swanky Chinses rest. and they ordered
lots of stuff I had never seen before. The only thing I can remember of that
meal was the first course, scallops served in the shell with a soy-type sauce.
I thought, ""Well, I've only had scallops once and I was sick after but that
could have been a coincidence"". That night as I sat on the bathroom floor,
sweating and emptying my stomach the hard way, I decided I would never touch
another scallop. I may not be allergic but I don't want to take the chance.

In four replies, I've seen no hard numbers, so here goes:  For traces
on the outside (not inner layers), expect, in 1 oz copper, at 15 amps,
the following temperature rises versus width.  This is from Sams'
""Reference Data for Engineers,"" seventh edition, Pg 5-30, which claims
in turn to be from MIL-STD-275C...

    width   Temp rise
    inches  degrees C
    ------  ---------
     .125	100
     .15	 75
     .17	 60
     .20	 45
     .24	 30
     .33	 20

At 10 amps, the rise for the .125 width is only about 30 degrees.
Power goes as square of the current, plus the copper resistance goes
up as temperature goes up...  Certainly .20"" (~5mm) traces should be 
ample for what you want to do.  And 2 ounce copper almost cuts the 
required width in half.  (I'd do 2 oz at about 0.08"" width myself, 
I think...given that the _rated_ current is 10 amps and the 15 is
a transient or fault condition.)

(There's another question: will the voltage drop be low enough?
But you should be able to figure this one out with wire tables or
just the resistivity of copper.  Keep traces short and use separate
sensing traces where appropriate, as mentioned by another poster.)

Ok, much as I hate to do it, here I am posting an EVEN BETTER ""Dr. Idiot""
story.


I was in my 18th hour of labor, had been pushing for 4.5 hours and was
exhausted.  My OB and I decided to go for a csec.  The OB called in
the anesthisiologist (sp?) and asked him to help prep me for surgery.

AFTER, watching me go through a couple contractions, the anes (or anus as
I like to refer to him) said, ""Well, I am off duty now."" (still staring
between my legs at that).  The OB asked to go call whomever it was who
was on duty and ask him/her how long it would take...and if it was going
to take more than a few minutes, to please stay even though he was off duty.

The anes. went out, supposedly to call the on-call anes.   In a couple of
minutes the nurse came running in to tell the OB that the anes. had left
without even trying to get ahold of the on-call.  It was the only time 
during my labor that I swore.  The on-call anes. took 20 minutes to get
there.

Come to find out, the anes. had only just gone off duty (about 2 minutes
before) and technically was supposed to stay in the hospital until the
next on-call got there.  Good thing for all of us (especially him) that
it was not a critical emergency.  But boy would I love to knock that
fellow's ouchie places ...just to let him be in pain a
few little minutes.

They are illegal here in Manitoba as well though I don't know what 
methods are used to detect them.

It has always amazed me with the way the laws work.  It is not illegal to 
sell them here in Manitoba, only to have them within a vehicle.  (Last I 
heard, they don't have to be installed to be illegal.)

Here in the UK, the bandwidth restriction apparently only apply to 
local lines.. ie those used by the average domestic client. Private
lines which are run from the local exchange to the leasing client are 
usually capable of a higher bandwidth if the exchange is digital.

saying something to that effect when I was doing some work
shadowing a few years ago.

If you read texts about ancient and primative people you will read about
the luxury of eating fat, how people enjoyed it. This was because it was so
rare. Even cows didn't put out nearly the amount of butterfat in milk that
they do now.

Since your MOSFET is a 1972 vintage, it's probably not a very good one by 
today's standards.  If you have an idea about its voltage and current 
ratings, e.g. 60VDC @ 6A, you can probably get away with replacing it with 
anything with better specs.  Early MOSFETS had a gate-source voltage rating 
of approximately +/- 20 VDCmax, and they would usually turn completely ""ON"" 
at +10VDC.  Otherwise, MOSFETS are not really mysterious -- they're more or 
less voltage controlled current sources.  If the MOSFET in your circuit is 
used as an open-loop, voltage controlled current source, you may have to 
experiment with various gain-altering techniques.

The graphics capabilities of the computers were very faked for movie 
audiences who have not ability or patience with numbers.  The book was more 
realistic in that respect.  In all respects, actually.  The robotics are 
still out of range, but not impossible.

SF (and I""ve always wondered how Crichton escapes this classification) is 
usually ahead of science in both prediction and precaution.  NASA's 
decontaimination processes were supposedly taken to prevent SF story 
disasters.  I mean, NASA scientists were often SF readers (and 
sometimes writers) and felt pre-warned by their reading.
